<h2>WELCOME TO MY MGD PROJECT</h2>
<p>INSERT MAP CLICKABLE IMAGE<BR>Here I want to start a concept of a website that would be able to help me intergrate my world travels to those I meet on the way. I often am asked: Who am I? Where have I been? Do you have pictures? Where should I hike when I visit there?I want to eat at a local authinetic place, where do I go? Where will you go soon? Do you have a YouTube? Blog? How can I fund your travels? </p>
