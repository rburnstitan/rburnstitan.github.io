<h1>((PacMAn))'s Corner</h1>
<h2>WELCOME TO MY MGD PROJECT</h2>
<p>Here I want to start a concept of a personal website influenced by social media.<BR>
  It will help me intergrate my world travels to those I meet on the way plus introduce them to my highlights in hopes of adding their highlights to my bucketlist.<BR>
  I often am asked: <BR>Who am I? Where have I been? Do you have pictures? Where should I hike when I visit there?I want to eat at a local authinetic place, where do I go? Where will you go soon? Do you have a YouTube? Blog? How can I fund your travels? </p>
